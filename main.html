				Chhichhore tells the story of Aniruddh "Anni" Pathak, a middle-aged divorcee whose son Raghav tries to commit suicide after failing to clear the JEE entrance examination, & who despite survival, is unwilling to live due to the fear of being branded as a 'loser', which makes a desperate Anni recount his own experience to Raghav of his own time at college, wherein he & his five friends too were called 'losers', & how they managed to remove that 'tag'; as he continues along to narrate his story, the other five join their friend & complete the story.
